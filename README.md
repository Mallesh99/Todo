Hello there..!

I built this Simple To-Do List Application using React-native.

Developed a fully functional to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. The app is intuitive and user-friendly. 

 

Key Features : 

Due Date: Each task can have a due date. 

Priority Levels: Assigned priority to tasks as Low, Medium, or High. 

Category: Can categorize tasks. 

Task Status: Can Mark tasks as New, In Progress, or Completed. 

Title and Description: Each task must have a title and a detailed description. 

Local Storage: The app uses local storage to save tasks i.e I used SQLLite

1) Basically, when app is opened we can see three divisions. They are:
   New 
   In Progess
   Completed
2) We can add new tasks by clicking the '+' icon on the bottom right corner of the mobile screen. By clicking on it we can add the new task.
3) While adding new task we can give the priority to the task that we are adding.
4) I denoted low priority task with green colour. I denoted medium priority with orange colour. I denoted high priority with red colour.
