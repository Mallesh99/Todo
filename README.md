Hello there..!

**Project Name** : TODO APPLICATION

I built this Simple To-Do List Application using React-native.

Developed a fully functional to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. The app is intuitive and user-friendly. 

 

**Key Features** : 

Priority Levels: Assigned priority to tasks as Low, Medium, or High. 

Category: Can categorize tasks. 

Task Status: Can Mark tasks as New, In Progress, or Completed. 

Title and Description: Each task must have a title and a detailed description. 

Local Storage: The app uses local storage to save tasks i.e I used SQLLite

**Description** :

1) Basically, when app is opened we can see three divisions. They are:
   Add_task
   On going
   Completed
2) We can add new tasks by clicking on the Add_Task tab.
3) While adding new task title and description for the task is compulsory.
4) While adding new task we should decide the priority to the task that we are adding. Then Click Add button on the bottom.
5) I denoted low priority task with green colour. I denoted medium priority with orange colour. I denoted high priority with red colour.
6) After adding, the added task is being showed in the on going tab. Until we view the added task it is marked as new, which can be seen on the right side of the task. Once we open it will be gone.
7) In on going tab, we can view the task by clicking on it.
8) We can see title,description and 3 buttons there. They are Back, Mark as Complete and Delete.
9) We can mark the task as complete by clicking the "Mark as Complete" button. Then the task is moved to the completed tab.
10) We can even delete the task using the "Delete" button.
11) If we click on the task which is in completed tab we cannot see option of deleting and marking as completion.Only Back button can be seen.


**Instructions to Setup and run the Application** :

1) Git clone the repository using the link which I will send on email.
2) Open vs code in that cloned directory.
3) Run command "npm i" to install all required dependencies. (P.S: Please install manually one or two if there are any errors because of versions)
4) "npm start" in that terminal.
5) Open another terminal and run the command "npm run android". (P.S: I believe you guys had setup Android SDK to run the Android App)
6) If you come across any problem please contact me. Thank You...!
